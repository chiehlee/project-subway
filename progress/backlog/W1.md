## Task #0005: Simplify Planning Documentation

### Remove MVP-centric content and unnecessary scope definitions
**Date Added**: 2026-02-08  
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
The planning.md document contains MVP-focused sections that don't apply to a one-person project where the developer is also the owner/operator. Need to simplify by removing phased success metrics and "out of scope" sections.

**Context**:
- This is a one-person project
- User owns the Subway restaurant and is building for their own store
- User is the sole developer, client, customer, and stakeholder
- MVP concept doesn't apply - can build and iterate based on immediate needs
- No need for formal phased rollouts or scope definitions

**Sections to Remove/Simplify**:
1. **Success Metrics** - Remove phased metrics (Phase 1/2/3 with specific timelines)
2. **Out of Scope (for MVP)** - Remove entirely (no need to define out-of-scope for self)
3. **All "MVP" mentions** - Replace with simpler language or remove

**Keep**:
- Timeline and Milestones (but simplify, remove MVP language)
- Open Questions (still useful)
- Appendix (Glossary, References, Change Log)

**Proposed Changes**:
- Replace "Success Metrics" with simpler "Initial Goals" or remove entirely
- Remove "Out of Scope" section completely
- Simplify Timeline section, remove "MVP" terminology
- Focus on practical milestones rather than formal phases

**Sub-tasks**:
1. Review planning.md and identify all MVP mentions
2. Remove or simplify Success Metrics section
3. Remove "Out of Scope" section entirely
4. Simplify Timeline section (keep milestones, remove MVP language)
5. Test documentation

**Rationale**:
- One-person project doesn't need formal MVP definitions
- User is both builder and customer - can iterate freely
- Simpler documentation is easier to maintain
- Focus on doing, not planning phases
- Remove corporate/enterprise planning artifacts

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ No mentions of "MVP" in any documentation
- ✅ Success Metrics section removed or greatly simplified
- ✅ "Out of Scope" section removed
- ✅ Timeline simplified but still useful
- ✅ Documentation reflects one-person project reality
