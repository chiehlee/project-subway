## Task #0002: Aggressive MkDocs Content Cleanup ✅

### Remove 80% of generated documentation, keep only essential technical/functional docs
**Date Added**: 2026-02-02  
**Date Updated**: 2026-02-08  
**Date Started**: 2026-02-08  
**Date Completed**: 2026-02-08  
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
The initial MkDocs setup generated too much content. Removed ~80% of generated files and restructured to focus solely on technical and functional requirements.

**Decisions Made**:
- Kept MkDocs but drastically simplified
- Removed all premature/scaffolding docs
- Kept only: PRD, user-stories, roadmap, system-design, data-model
- Created minimal index.md as entry point
- Non-functional requirements: deferred decision, can add later

**Sub-tasks**:
1. ✅ Clarified scope
2. ✅ Removed unnecessary files (GETTING_STARTED, README, CONTRIBUTING, DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE)
3. ✅ Removed coding-standards (can add back if needed)
4. ✅ Removed 03-features/ folder (premature)
5. ✅ Removed 05-development/ folder (premature)
6. ✅ Simplified index.md to minimal entry point
7. ✅ Updated mkdocs.yml with minimal navigation
8. ✅ Tested `make docs-serve` - works with minor warning about anchor

**What Was Done**:
- Deleted files: GETTING_STARTED.md (335 lines), README.md (77 lines), CONTRIBUTING.md, DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Deleted folders: 03-features/, 05-development/
- Rewrote index.md from 130 lines to 27 lines (79% reduction)
- Simplified mkdocs.yml - removed navigation tabs, emojis, task lists, extra social links
- Updated root README.md to reflect new simplified documentation structure
- Removed references to deleted files in Quick Links and Project Structure
- Final structure: only index.md, 01-product/, 02-architecture/

**Results**:
- Documentation files reduced from ~10 files to 6 files (PRD, user-stories, roadmap, system-design, data-model, index)
- Clean, focused structure on functional and technical requirements
- Documentation serves successfully on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- One minor warning about missing anchor in system-design.md (non-critical)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ ~80% of current documentation files removed
- ✅ Only essential functional/technical docs remain
- ✅ Simple, clear documentation structure
- ✅ Kept MkDocs with simplified config
- ✅ Non-functional requirements placement deferred
- ✅ Documentation serves correctly with `make docs-serve`

## Task #0003: Further Documentation Simplification ✅

### Remove roadmap and user stories, focus on technical/functional requirements only
**Date Added**: 2026-02-08  
**Date Started**: 2026-02-08  
**Date Completed**: 2026-02-08  
**Priority**: High

**Description**:
After cleanup in Task #0002, further simplification needed. Roadmap and user stories are premature for current phase. Focus documentation on only essential technical and functional requirements.

**Files Removed**:
- `docs/01-product/user-stories.md` - Premature, can recreate when needed
- `docs/01-product/roadmap.md` - Premature, can recreate when needed

**Files Kept**:
- `docs/01-product/PRD.md` - Core functional requirements
- `docs/02-architecture/system-design.md` - Technical architecture
- `docs/02-architecture/data-model.md` - Database design

**Sub-tasks**:
1. ✅ Removed user-stories.md and roadmap.md
2. ✅ Updated mkdocs.yml navigation to remove these entries
3. ✅ Updated docs/index.md to remove references
4. ✅ Updated root README.md Quick Links and removed roadmap reference
5. ✅ Kept 01-product folder with just PRD.md
6. ✅ Tested `make docs-serve` - works correctly

**What Was Done**:
- Deleted user-stories.md and roadmap.md from docs/01-product/
- Updated mkdocs.yml to show only PRD under Product section
- Simplified docs/index.md Product Documentation section (now just PRD link)
- Updated root README.md Quick Links to remove user stories and roadmap
- Removed roadmap reference from "Next Steps" section
- Verified folder structure: only PRD.md remains in 01-product/

**Results**:
- Documentation now contains only 4 pages: index, PRD, system-design, data-model
- Clear focus on functional requirements (PRD) and technical architecture
- Documentation serves successfully on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Same minor warning about missing anchor in system-design.md (non-critical)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ user-stories.md and roadmap.md removed
- ✅ Navigation updated in mkdocs.yml and index.md
- ✅ Root README.md updated

**Date Started**: 2026-02-08  
**Date Completed**: 2026-02-08  
**Priority**: Medium

**Description**:
The PRD.md file was 336 lines and contained multiple major sections. Split it into separate subpages for better navigation and maintainability.

**Final Structure**:
```
docs/01-product/
├── overview.md          # Executive Summary, Target Users (47 lines)
├── features.md          # All Core Features (150 lines)
├── requirements.md      # Non-Functional Requirements + Technical Constraints (75 lines)
└── planning.md          # Success Metrics, Timeline, Open Questions, Appendix (110 lines)
```

**Sub-tasks**:
1. ✅ Decided on final structure (flat, 4 pages)
2. ✅ Improved Executive Summary content (removed Vision/Problem redundancy)
3. ✅ Created 4 new files with reorganized content
4. ✅ Removed old PRD.md
5. ✅ Updated mkdocs.yml navigation structure
6. ✅ Updated docs/index.md references
7. ✅ Updated root README.md Quick Links with better organization
8. ✅ Tested documentation - serves correctly

**What Was Done**:
- Rewrote Executive Summary to be cleaner and more actionable (Problem → Solution → Goals)
- Split 336-line PRD.md into 4 focused pages
- Deleted original PRD.md
- Updated mkdocs.yml to show 4 Product subpages
- Updated docs/index.md with clear descriptions of each page
- Enhanced README.md Quick Links with section headers and better emojis
- Added version 0.2.0 to change log noting the split

**Content Improvements**:
- Executive Summary: Combined redundant Vision/Problem Statement into clear Problem → Solution flow
- Added specific metric to Goals (5-10 hours/week time savings)
- Each page is now self-contained and focused on one aspect
- Better navigation with descriptive page titles

**Results**:
- Documentation now has 4 manageable pages instead of 1 long page
- Each page is 47-150 lines (much more digestible)
- Clear separation of concerns: Overview → Features → Requirements → Planning
- MkDocs navigation shows logical structure
- Search functionality works across all pages
- Documentation serves successfully on http://127.0.0.1:8000

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ PRD content split into logical subpages
- ✅ Clear navigation structure in mkdocs.yml
- ✅ All internal links working
- ✅ Search functionality works across all pages
- ✅ Documentation serves correctly with `make docs-serve`
- ✅ Each subpage is self-contained and focused
